# State-Demographics

This is a simple project using the CORGIS dataset to compare and visualize different sets of data for each state. The current state of the program compares
school math scores to the median income of the chosen state, but the functionality can be altered to use whatever dataset the CORGIS database has to offer.

The MatPlotLib API is used to visualize the data, and the program must be run on the CORGIS server to access the data.
